## A Model Driven Code Generation Engine

Don't try yourself that much! These days, focusing on business and architectural requirements reallt matters. Then as a software engineer we shouldn't waste our time and budget in producing repeated codes. Hence Code Generation is a must!__
In this project I produced a code generation engine which is able to produce java and angular codes based on hexagonal architecture. The main models are entity and usecase models. These models are the input of the engine. Then after the engine completely digest those models, it generates all the needed codes for spring boot and angular frameworks. The generated codes is executive, therefore it is useful for prototyping.
